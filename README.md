# Tower of Hanoi
## Description of Project
The Tower of Hanoi is a classic puzzle that can be solved with recursion. Take a stab at playing it through this exercise, and see if you can figure out the pattern.

## How to Run
To view the webpage, please visit https://aelamothe.github.io/hanoi-tower. Optionally enter a number into the input box. Click "Make Move" to start, and continue clicking the button to watch as the puzzle is solved. An alert will pop up once the puzzle is completed.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements
In the next iteration of this project, I'd like to make this an interactive game so that users can attempt to solve the puzzle by themselves.
